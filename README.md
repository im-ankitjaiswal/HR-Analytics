### 1. **Sales Department Overview**:
   - **Total Employees**: 446.

### 3. **Attrition by Age Group**:
   - The highest attrition occurs among employees aged **26-35**, with over 40 employees leaving. This suggests that mid-career employees in this age range are leaving at a higher rate.
   - There is moderate attrition in the **18-25**, **46-55**, and **36-45** age groups, each contributing around 15-20 employees.
   - Attrition is low for the **55+** age group, suggesting more retention in older employees.

### 4. **Attrition by Job Role**:
   - The **Sales Executive** role shows the highest attrition, with 57 employees leaving.
   - **Sales Representatives** also show significant attrition, with 33 employees leaving.
   - **Managers** in the Sales department experience very low attrition, with only 2 employees leaving.

### 5. **Salary Slab and Attrition**:
   - Most of the employees who left the Sales department earned in the **Upto 5k** salary range. This suggests that employees in the lower pay bracket are more likely to leave.
   - Attrition decreases as salary increases. Employees in the **5k-10k** salary slab also exhibit notable attrition, but employees in the **10k-15k** and **15k+** ranges show very low attrition.

### 6. **Attrition by Salary Slab and Job Role**:
   - The **Sales Executive** role dominates in the lower salary slab (Upto 5k), and unsurprisingly, it experiences the highest attrition.
   - **Sales Representatives** also show significant attrition, though they are spread across both the **Upto 5k** and **5k-10k** salary slabs.
   - **Managers** have minimal attrition, and their salaries tend to be higher.

### 7. **Attrition by Average Age and Years of Working**:
   - Attrition peaks early, with 17 employees leaving within the first year of work.
   - There is a sharp decline in attrition as tenure increases, with another notable spike at around 7 years of tenure (13 employees).
   - Attrition is generally low after 5 years, which suggests that once employees stay for more than a few years, they are more likely to remain with the company long term.

### **Key Conclusions for the Sales Department**:
   - **High Attrition in Sales Executives**: The role with the highest turnover is **Sales Executive**, especially among employees in the **Upto 5k** salary bracket and those in the **26-35 age group**.
   - **Lower Pay Correlates with Higher Attrition**: Employees in the lower salary slabs, especially **Upto 5k**, tend to leave more frequently. Improving compensation could help address this.
   - **Attrition in Early Career Stages**: There is a high rate of attrition within the first year, indicating possible onboarding or job satisfaction issues.
   - **Mid-Career Attrition**: Employees aged **26-35** are leaving at higher rates, possibly due to career growth expectations or external opportunities.

Overall, the Sales department may need to focus on improving compensation and addressing concerns for early-career employees to retain talent, especially in the Sales Executive role.

   - There is some attrition in the **5k-10k** range, but very little to none in the higher salary brackets (**10k-15k** and **15k+**).

### **Key Conclusions for Research & Development Department**:
   - **Laboratory Technicians** are the most vulnerable to attrition, especially those in the lower salary brackets. Improving compensation for this group could help retain them.
   - **Younger employees (26-35)** and those with **1 year of tenure** are leaving at higher rates. This suggests the need for enhanced career development opportunities and possibly better onboarding processes to retain new hires.
   - Employees with more experience, such as **Research Scientists**, show a more moderate but still notable attrition rate. Career progression and salary adjustments for these roles may improve retention.

Overall, attrition is concentrated in lower-paid, younger employees in the **Laboratory Technician** and **Research Scientist** roles. Improving compensation, career growth opportunities, and onboarding processes could help address these issues.

**Key Observations:**

### Attrition Rate
* **High Attrition:** The overall attrition rate is 19%, which is relatively high. This suggests a need to investigate factors contributing to employee turnover.
* **Human Resources Department:** The Human Resources department has the highest attrition rate among the three departments (7/12 or 58%). This is a significant concern and requires immediate attention.

### Job Role and Attrition
* **Human Resources:** As mentioned earlier, the Human Resources department has the highest attrition. This could be due to factors such as workload, job satisfaction, or internal company culture.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Investigate Factors Contributing to High Attrition:** Conduct surveys or interviews to understand the reasons behind the high attrition rate in the Human Resources department.
